Created a simple Streamlit UI where users enter one/multiple sentences.
After this, the unique words are extracted from the sentences, to create the Bag of Words, and create tokens for each word.
User then enters another sentence called Query Sentence.
Query sentence is then compared with the Bag of Words to find the closes matching sentences by performing cosine similarity.
